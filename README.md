This repository contains a JavaScript code example that demonstrates a potential stack overflow error due to uncontrolled recursion. The function `foo` recursively subtracts 1 from both inputs until one of them reaches 0.  If the inputs are large, this recursion can lead to a stack overflow. The solution demonstrates how to refactor the code to use iteration, avoiding the stack overflow.
